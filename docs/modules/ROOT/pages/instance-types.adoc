= Instance Types

Hazelcast Cloud Enterprise allows you to choose the underlying machine instance type on which a Hazelcast cluster is deployed. You can select it while *creating a cluster* and also change it later when *updating the cluster*.

== Create Cluster

While creating a new dedicated cluster, you can select the desired instance type in the cluster creation form:

This instance type decides on the underlying virtual machine, which is specific to the selected cloud provider. It is used as the host machine for the Hazelcast member.
