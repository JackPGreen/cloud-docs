= Migrating Data to Another Cluster

The goal of this document is to describe how to migrate data from one cluster to another.

== Prerequisites

Your cluster must be on the link:{page-plans}[Enterprise plan] to use this feature.

You need at least two xref:create-enterprise-cluster.adoc[Enterprise clusters] with the same configuration. For example, if one cluster
contains xref:custom-classes-upload.adoc[custom classes], xref:backup-and-restore.adoc[backup], or persistence,
you should enable and configure these options for the other cluster as well.

== Step 1. Create WAN Replication

In this tutorial, we are going to use a fantastic Hazelcast feature for data migration which is called xref:wan-replication.adoc[WAN Replication]

In order to create WAN Replication, you can go to *Cluster Detail* > *Settings* > *Wan Replication* and click *Create New Replication*

After setting all these parameters, you can click *Next* to select and configure consumer cluster.

Settings on this screen for consumer cluster are same as publisher cluster except *Active/Passive* section. If you set consumer cluster as *Active*, data will be synchronized from/to publisher and consumer. If you set consumer cluster as *Passive*, data will be sent only from publisher to consumer.
Once you configured settings for consumer, you can click *Save*

Within seconds, wan replication will be ready there.

Once it is finished, you can verify it by going to management center *Cluster Detail* > *Management Center* > *Enable*  then *Management Center* > *Open Management Center*.

When you connect publish cluster and try to write some data, you will see data will be replicated to consumer cluster.

NOTE: You can synchronize all data by using `Sync` button in the WAN replication settings.

== Step 2. Connect to a Cluster

After migration is done, you can connect to a new cluster via different clients, e.g. xref:java-client.adoc[]

== Step 3. Delete the Old Cluster

You can delete your old cluster once migration finished and clients connected to a new cluster.

NOTE: WAN replication must be deleted before cluster deletion
