= IP Whitelisting
:description: Clusters that are exposed to the Internet allow any client with the correct credentials to connect to them. To grant access only to specific clients, you can add their IP addresses to a whitelist.

== Before you Begin

If you're on the Enterprise plan, you can use IP whitelisting only if you turned on public access while creating the cluster. Otherwise, your cluster is private and you need to set up peering to allow clients to connect to it. See xref:connect-to-private-cluster.adoc[].

To add IP addresses to the whitelist of a team's cluster, you must have either an admin or developer role. See xref:teams-and-users.adoc[].
