There are 4 different roles that you can assign to the team members:

- View Only: This role can only view the charts and metrics but cannot create, stop or update the clusters.
- Developer: ThÄ±s role can update the cluster in addition to seeing the charts and metrics. But it cannot update and access payment settings and team settings.
- Admin: This role has access to everything including payment and team settings.
- Finance: This role has only access to payment setting and billing information.

After creating your team, refresh your dashboard. You will see a dropdown menu selection on top-right corner of your dashboard:
