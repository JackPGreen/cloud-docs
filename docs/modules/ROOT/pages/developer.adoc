The Hazelcast Cloud allows you to manage your resources and clusters via link:{url-cloud-api}[API], link:{url-github-go-sdk}[SDK], and link:{url-github-cloud-cli}[CLI]. You can get further details about them from xref:api-reference.adoc[API Reference].

In order to use these applications, you need to provide API Key and API Secret. This API Key and API Secret can be created from link:{url-cloud-developers}[Developers] tab in Settings as shown below. 

== Creating API Key and API Secret

You can easily create a new API Key from the *Generate new API Key* button on this page. Then you can use these credentials on our applications to make actions. Currently, you can only create 1 API Key and API Secret pair on your account.

NOTE: You can only see API Secret once you created it. So, you should copy them once you created.

IMPORTANT: You should keep API Key and Secret as secret. Anyone who has them can make any actions like deleting your cluster on Hazelcast Cloud.

== Deleting API Key

You can delete your API Key anytime you want from the *Delete API Key* button as shown below.

WARNING: After you delete your API Key, every application you used this API Key and API Secret won't work unless you supply the new API Key and API Secret.
