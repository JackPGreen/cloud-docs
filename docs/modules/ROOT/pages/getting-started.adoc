:description: It's free to create an account on Hazelcast Cloud and get started with a free cluster.

{description}

To set up a free cluster, you need to do the following:

. Create a Hazelcast Cloud account
. Create your free cluster
. Add data to your cluster

== 1. Create a Hazelcast Cloud Account

. Go to link:{url-cloud-sign-up}[] and enter your details.
+
A confirmation will be sent to the provided email address. After confirming your email address, you'll be able to log into your account.

. Go to link:{url-cloud-sign-in}[] and log into your account, using one of the following options:
+
- The email address and password that you provided when you created the account
- Your GitHub account
- Your Google account

NOTE: If you don't use your free cluster for 16 hours or more, it will be deleted along with any data that was stored in it.

== 2. Create a Free Cluster

. Click the *+ New Cluster* button in the top-left corner.

. In the basic plan, click *Create Cluster*.

It may take up to 30 seconds to create the cluster. Until the cluster is ready, you will see a pending label and a spinning wheel.

Once your cluster is running and ready, you will see the Cluster Memory and Client Count charts as well as lifecycle information about the cluster.

Now, you have a running cluster, but it is empty. You can add data to the cluster, using a Hazelcast client application.

== 3. Add Data to your Cluster
  
. Click the *Configure Clients* button.

. Choose the client language that you want to use and follow the on-screen instructions.
+
These instructions show you how to download and run a client application that inserts random entries into maps on your cluster. After 5-10 seconds, exit the application, using *Ctrl+C*.

. Scroll down to Map Metrics and select the map called `map`.
