=== 2.1 (Optional) Sign-in with Social Providers

You can use also use sign-in with Github and Google options in order to sign-in easily without spending your time on email verification and filling registration forms. The only thing you should do is selecting your social provider and authorizing Hazelcast Cloud for registration purposes. Then it will directly redirect you to our console.

== 3. Create a Cluster

After successfully logging in, you can create your first cluster by clicking the *+ New Cluster* button in the top left corner. On the New Cluster page, provide a name for your cluster. You can leave the other options as they are. Click *+ Create Cluster* to create and start your new cluster.

Once your cluster is running and ready, you will see the Cluster Memory and Client Count charts as well as lifecycle information about the cluster.

== 4. Set-Up and Run the Hazelcast Client

Now, we have a running cluster, but it is empty. So, let's fill it with data. To do so, we need to run a Hazelcast client application.  

In the cloud console, open the cluster that you want to connect to. Click on the *Configure Hazelcast Client* button. Step 1 provides you a pre-configured sample client project. Download that. Step 2 provides a command. Copy that command and run it in your command line. In the logs you should see `Connection Successful!` and then the application will start to insert random entries. After 5-10 seconds you will see map stats in your cluster dashboard as below:
