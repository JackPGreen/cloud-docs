= Managing Credits

If you have a promo code then you can use it to redeem credit. As long as your credit balance is positive, any usage will be deducted from your credit balance. When you are out of credit, and if you do not have any other payment method defined, then your clusters will be stopped.

== Before you Begin

To manage credits for a team, you must have either an admin or finance role. See xref:teams-and-users.adoc[].

== Redeeming Credits

To see the remaining credit balance, go to *Settings* > *Credits*.

To redeem credits, enter a promo code and click *REDEEM*.
