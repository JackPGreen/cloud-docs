= Availability Zones

You can deploy your Hazelcast cluster onto multiple availability zones to prevent data loss in case of a zone failure. This feature is backed by the xref:imdg:clusters:partition-group-configuration.adoc[partition grouping] feature of Hazelcast IMDG. Note that a single-zone cluster usually performs better than the multiple-zone deployments.

To enable a multi-zone deployment, select two or more availability zones when creating a new cluster in the cluster creation form:
