= Deploying Clusters on Multiple Availability Zones
:description: To prevent data loss after a zone failure, you can deploy your Hazelcast clusters on multiple availability zones.

{description}

To enable a multi-zone deployment, select two or more availability zones when creating a new cluster in the cluster creation form:

Multi-zone deployments use the xref:hazelcast:clusters:partition-group-configuration.adoc[partition grouping] feature of Hazelcast.

NOTE: A single-zone cluster usually performs better than a multiple-zone deployment.
