= Reading Charts and Statistics

Once you have a running cluster, you can monitor the performance metrics and status using the Hazelcast Cloud console. To monitor, click on your cluster's name in the "Clusters" page to see the cluster details which include the charts for monitoring purposes. In this "Cluster Details" page, these charts are grouped into cluster and map metrics, and client statistics.

NOTE: There can be about 5-10 seconds of latency between cluster events and when they display on the charts.

The charts are updated every 5 seconds. When you hover your mouse cursor onto any chart area, you can see the related value corresponding to the cursor's location.

== Cluster Metrics

In the *Cluster Metrics* part of the "Cluster Details" page, you can see the charts described in the below sections.

=== Cluster Memory Chart

This chart shows your cluster's memory capacity (`Cluster Max Memory`, the blue line) and the size of currently used memory (`Cluster Used Memory`, the orange line). As the orange line approaches the blue line, you should think about scaling up. Note that `Cluster Used Memory` is the total amount of memory used for both primary and backup entries.

=== Client Count Chart

This chart shows the number of clients that are connected to your cluster.

== Map Metrics

Below the Cluster Metrics, you see the *Map Metrics* where the charts specific to maps are displayed. You can select the map that you want to monitor from the drop down just under the Map Metrics heading, as shown below.

NOTE: If you are not connected to the cluster via a client and have not created a map, the Map Metrics part will be empty.

In the *Map Metrics* part of the Cluster Details page, you can see the charts described in the below sections.

=== Map Used Memory Chart

This chart shows how many megabytes of data is being used by this map. The value is the total memory of both primary and backup entries. For example, if you have put 100 entries with 1 KB of size each and if your map's backup count is 1, then the value of `Map Used Memory` should be 200 KB.

=== Average Latency Chart

This chart shows the average latency values (in milliseconds) for the get, put, and remove operations.

=== Throughput Chart

This chart shows the total number of get, put, and remove operations executed by the cluster per second.

=== Entry Count Chart

This chart shows the count of entries in the map. This count does not include the backup entries. So, it provides the same count as the `map.size()` API.

=== Hit Ratio Chart

This chart shows the number of get operations that return a value, divided by the total number of all get operations.

=== Read/Write Ratio Chart

This chart shows the total number of get operations, divided by the total number of put operations at any time.

== Client Statistics

Below the Map Metrics, you see the "Client Statistics". It shows the list of clients connected to your cluster.

Each client name in this list includes a unique ID that is automatically generated by the client. You can see the client details by clicking on any client's name.

=== Client Details

When you click on a client's name, you will see a panel that provides detailed information about the client as shown below:
