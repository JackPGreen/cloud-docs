== Before you Begin

To delete clusters in a team, you must have either an admin or developer role. See xref:teams-and-users.adoc[].

== Delete a Cluster

To delete a cluster, go to *Manage Cluster* and click *Delete*.

When you delete a cluster, all the data related to the cluster, including the configuration and actual cluster data, are removed. There is no way of recovering any data from a deleted cluster. Think twice before clicking *Delete*.
