= Stopping and Deleting Clusters
:description: After creating a cluster, you can either stop it to save the configuration but stop charges accumulating or you can delete it all together.

== Prerequisites

To stop or delete clusters in a team, you must have either an admin or developer role. See xref:teams-and-users.adoc[].

== Stopping a Cluster

To stop a cluster, go to *MANAGE CLUSTER* and click *STOP*.

When you stop a cluster, Hazelcast Cloud saves your configuration so that you can resume the cluster at a later time with the exact same configuration. If you have enabled persistence while creating the cluster, the cluster data will also be persisted and available after you resume the cluster. Stopping your cluster can help minimize your costs while during development because you are only charged for the running clusters. So you can resume and run your cluster only when you are actively working with it.

TIP: When you stop a cluster, you are not charged. So it is a good practice to stop it when you are not using it in development phase.

== Deleting a Cluster

To delete a cluster, go to *MANAGE CLUSTER* and click *DELETE*.

When you delete a cluster, all the data related to the cluster, including the configuration and actual cluster data, are removed. There is no way of recovering any data from a deleted cluster. Think twice before clicking *Delete*. 

WARNING: Persistence has a performance overhead. If you are not planning to use the Stop/Resume feature, you will achieve better performance leaving it disabled.
