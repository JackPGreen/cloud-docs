= Uploading Custom Classes
:description: To store and query custom objects, those objects' classes must be on the classpath of your cluster members. In Hazelcast Cloud, you can upload custom classes by dragging and dropping files in the UI.

{description}

You may need to upload custom Java classes in the following situations:

. You have objects that run on the cluster via clients such as `Runnable`, `Callable` and entry processors.
. You have new or amended user domain objects
. You have your own `MapLoader` or `MapStore` implementations.

== Prerequisites

You need a cluster that has at least two members (nodes).

WARNING: Custom classes are uploaded onto clusters by using rolling restart, which relies on shutting down each member one at a time. As a result, your cluster may lose all its data if it consists of a single member.

Your files must be in either `zip` or `jar` format and the maximum file size is 500 MB.

Uploaded classes are restricted by a limited set of JSP permissions. If you need your uploaded code to be granted any additional permissions, link:https://hazelcast.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/signin?return_to=https%3A%2F%2Fhazelcast.zendesk.com%2Fhc%2Fen-us%2Frequests%2Fnew[create a support ticket] for it.

To upload custom classes onto a team's cluster, you must have either an admin or developer role. See xref:teams-and-users.adoc[].

== Uploading Files

To upload JAR files with custom classes, click *Upload Custom Classes*.

Once you click on it, the following dialog appears where you can drag your file to or select it using the `browse` link:

Once the upload is successfully finished and the progress indicator disappeared, the custom classes are deployed and ready to use:

== Removing Files

To remove custom classes from the cluster, click *Upload Custom Classes*, find your class in the list and click on the delete icon next to it.
