= Custom Classes Upload

In Hazelcast cluster, you need to upload custom Java classes for the following situations:

. You have objects that run on the cluster via the clients such as `Runnable`, `Callable` and entry processors.
. You have new or amended user domain objects, e.g., in-memory format of the `IMap` set to `Object`, which need to be deployed into the cluster.
. You have your own `MapLoader` or `MapStore` implementations.

WARNING: Uploaded custom classes are deployed onto the cluster by using rolling restart, hence there is a risk to lose data if cluster consists of one member.

It's allowed to upload files with extensions `zip` and `jar` only. The maximum file size is 500MB.

[WARNING]
====
Uploaded classes are restricted by a limited set of JSP permissions.

If you need your uploaded code to be granted any additional permissions, please create a support ticket for it.

or during cluster creation:

Once you click on it, the following dialog appears where you can drag your file to or select it using the `browse` link:

Once the upload is successfully finished and the progress indicator disappeared, the custom classes are deployed and ready to use:
